Description:
    Outcomes for cancer patients vary greatly even within the same tumor type, and characterization of molecular subtypes of cancer holds important promise for improving 
    prognosis and personalized treatment. This promise has motivated recent efforts to produce large amounts of multidimensional genomic ('multi-omic') data, but current 
    algorithms still face challenges in the integrated analysis of such data. In this package we provide the implementation of Cancer Integration via Multikernel Learning 
    (CIMLR), a new cancer subtyping method that integrates multi-omic data to reveal molecular subtypes of cancer.
